# MVC_Simstation
SimStation is a framework for creating simulations based on the multi-agent or agent-based architecture. It allows users to simulate various scenarios involving populations of agents interacting within an environment. Examples of simulations include flocking behavior, random walks, plague spread, and Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments.
***

**Custom Simulations**

Random Walks: Simulates agents moving in random directions for a specified number of steps.

Flocking: Simulates birds interacting with nearby neighbors, resulting in cohesive flocking behavior.

Plague: Models the spread of a virus through a population, with infected and susceptible agents.

Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament: Simulates a tournament where agents play the Prisoner's Dilemma game, evolving strategies over time.

**Assignment**

Phase 1) Complete the implementation of SimStation

Phase 2) Test your simulation by creating the flocking, random walks, plague, and PD tournament simulations.
